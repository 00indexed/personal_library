### Purpose: 
Mostly just for fun, I was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w1CG8bGNpQ&ab_channel=CharlotteAten) and she mentioned wishing there was an open-source alternative to overleaf for collaborative LaTeX text editing. Of course I thought, "I can make that!" but after some consideration (10 seconds), I decided to start with a basic (but cool) peer to peer collaborative text editor. 

### Concepts to explore : 
-  [Differential Syncing](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/sync/)
-  [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/)
-  [Operational transformation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation)

### Examples: 
-  [scratchPad](https://github.com/tOkeshu/scratchpad)
